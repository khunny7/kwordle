# Minimal Electron + React (Vite) App

This project is a minimal Electron app using React and Vite, following modern best practices with as few dependencies as possible.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start in development: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Structure
- `src/` - React source code
- `public/` - Static assets
- `main.js` - Electron main process

## Notes
- This setup is intentionally minimal. Add features as needed.
